## About
Born in 🇨🇳 and raised in 🇨🇦, I've been on a language journey (spoken and programming ones) my whole life. </br>

Until I discovered coding, my fascination with language and culture led me to learning Spanish in Guatemala 🇬🇹 and teaching English in Japan 🇯🇵. </br>
For a long time, I saw myself becoming a language specialist (interpretation/translation) until I discovered web development via Scrimba in 2022. </br>
You could say that I discovered new ecosystem and I have never looked back since. 

While this new journey in programming languages continue, I will keep going with my spoken ones as well. 
I hope to converse with speakers of all 6 UN languages, so besides eventually learning C, Java, and Python, there's also looking at Arabic, Russian, and French.

My hobbies:
- backpacking, camping, wilderness survival 🏕️!
- language learning & cultural immersion (you saw this one coming)
- badminton, badminton, more badminton 🏸
- all things Japan 🏯
- liberal arts readings (world history, philosophy, sociology)
