To me, learning to code is as much of an outward exploration as it is an inward endeavor.
It's my way of making a statement against my own beliefs about what I can or can't do.
Through this continual process of challenge and growth, I hope we become further inspired.  


My best work so far is the curated profiles of these Tindog profiles, (Tindog - Tinder for dogs)[https://tiny-mochi-3e1c9c.netlify.app/]

🕛 For a long time, Jack thought he wasn't smart enough for programming 😮‍💨, unlike his peers whom just seemed to get it 😎.  
After avoiding programming for most of his school years 🏫  and early working years after university 🎓, he reached a point in
time where had to make a choice about his life trajectories 🚦 . 

🤔 He decided to revisit a long-held beliefs he had about himself: 🖥️ Programming is too hard for him. 
🏃 He knew that belief only led to avoidance, but what he needed to was growth. 🌲
🏋️ He had to challenge his own belief about what he can and can't do. 💪

It's only been a short while (Oct, 2022) since Jack started his path but he is making good progress. 🚀

He doesn't know what's ahead but he's not worried. He's excited for what's to come. 
And one thing is for sure, he's glad he's glad to have made the change :)
