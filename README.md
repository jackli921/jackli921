I’m a designer and builder of my imagination 🎨🏗️. 
I’m fascinated by the world we live in, how it’s evolving, and how we influence each other. 
I’ve been most fascinated by the cultures and languages in our world, which has led me to various places 🌎.

Prior to becoming a web developer, I:
1. Hitchhiked & backpacked across mainland China 🇨🇳🚶‍♂️🎒
2. Studied Spanish in Guatemala 🇬🇹📚🌎
3. Taught English in Japan 🇯🇵👨‍🏫

I also failed at becoming a UX designer, which is how I discovered web development. My passion for design never left me, which is why I found web development to be a great alternative for me to:

1. Stay in touch with learning more about user experience design 🤔💡
2. Take on a personal challenge to overcome my long-held fear of programming 🚀👨‍💻
3. Pivot into a profession that has the ability to improve people’s lives and well-being at scale 🌟👨‍💻

Despite being self-taught, I’m confident in my technical skill set because of my education with Scrimba and my success with self-imposed stretch goals. My portfolio projects demonstrate my skills in building responsive websites and web apps using APIs, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and React. 💪💻🌐

Currently, I’m:
1. Hunting for front-end roles with quality mentorship 🔍
2. Integrating TypeScript and Tailwind into my portfolio projects 💻
3. Helping new developers improve through recording code reviews 🤝

If you are looking to nurture a junior frontend developer who is curious, teachable, eager to contribute, and has a good attitude, then I won’t disappoint. 🤞

🕛 For a long time, Jack thought he wasn't smart enough for programming 😮‍💨, unlike his peers whom just seemed to get it 😎.  
After avoiding programming for most of his school years 🏫  and early working years after university 🎓, he reached a point in
time where had to make a choice about his life trajectories 🚦 . 

🤔 He decided to revisit a long-held beliefs he had about himself: 🖥️ Programming is too hard for him. 
🏃 He knew that belief only led to avoidance, but what he needed to was growth. 🌲
🏋️ He had to challenge his own belief about what he can and can't do. 💪

It's only been a short while (Oct, 2022) since Jack started his path but he is making good progress. 🚀

He doesn't know what's ahead but he's not worried. He's excited for what's to come. 
And one thing is for sure, he's glad he's glad to have made the change :)
