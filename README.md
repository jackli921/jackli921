## About
Born in 🇨🇳 and raised in 🇨🇦, I've been on a language journey (spoken and programming ones) my whole life. Up until I discovered the programming side, I had learned  Mandarin, English, French, studied Spanish in Guatemala, and ultimately becoming fascinated with Japan and Japanese for last decade. I'm pursuing my dream of being immserd in the cultures of all 7 UN languages.

I learned to code to overcome my fears of programming. It's my way to re-inventing myself.
I'm most excited about works that improves people's well-beings and the environment.
Talk to me about badminton 🏸, learning new spoken languages, and all things Japan. </br>


## Contact
Currently, I’m:
1. Hunting for front-end roles with quality mentorship 🔍
2. Integrating TypeScript and Tailwind into my portfolio projects 💻
3. Helping new developers improve through recording code reviews 🤝

If you are looking to nurture a junior frontend developer who is curious, teachable, eager to contribute, and has a good attitude, then I won’t disappoint. 🤞

🕛 For a long time, Jack thought he wasn't smart enough for programming 😮‍💨, unlike his peers whom just seemed to get it 😎.  
After avoiding programming for most of his school years 🏫  and early working years after university 🎓, he reached a point in
time where had to make a choice about his life trajectories 🚦 . 

🤔 He decided to revisit a long-held beliefs he had about himself: 🖥️ Programming is too hard for him. 
🏃 He knew that belief only led to avoidance, but what he needed to was growth. 🌲
🏋️ He had to challenge his own belief about what he can and can't do. 💪

It's only been a short while (Oct, 2022) since Jack started his path but he is making good progress. 🚀

He doesn't know what's ahead but he's not worried. He's excited for what's to come. 
And one thing is for sure, he's glad he's glad to have made the change :)
