## About
Born in 🇨🇳 and raised in 🇨🇦, I've been on a language journey (spoken and programming ones) my whole life. </br>

Before coding, my fascination with language and culture led me to learning Spanish in Guatemala and teaching English in Japan. </br>
For a long time, I saw myself becoming a spoken language specialist such as an interpretation or a translator. </br>
But all that changed when I discovered web development through Scrimba in 2022. </br>

You could say that I found myself a new ecosystem; </br>
A brand new playground to challenge myself and follow my curiosity. </br>
But most importantly, as a way to reinvent myself.

While this new journey in programming languages continue, I will keep going with my spoken ones as well. </br>
