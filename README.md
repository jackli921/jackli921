Learning to program is as much of an outward exploration as it is an inward endeavor.
To me, it's a constant reminder to myself of what I believe what I can do instead of what I can't.
And I think the journey would be even better with a few like-minded friends, inspiring each other along the way. 


I think my best works come together when I'm having fun, like building (Tindog - Tinder for dogs)[https://tiny-mochi-3e1c9c.netlify.app/]

🕛 For a long time, Jack thought he wasn't smart enough for programming 😮‍💨, unlike his peers whom just seemed to get it 😎.  
After avoiding programming for most of his school years 🏫  and early working years after university 🎓, he reached a point in
time where had to make a choice about his life trajectories 🚦 . 

He decided to revisit a long-held beliefs he had about himself: Programming is too hard for him. 
He knew that belief only led to avoidance, what he needed to do was growth. 
He had his challenge his own belief about what he can and can't do. 

It's only been a short while (Oct, 2022) since Jack started his path but he is making good progress.

He doesn't know what's ahead but he's not worried. 
He's excited for what's to come. 
And one thing he believes is that, he is building towards something.
